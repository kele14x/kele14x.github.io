# About Me and This Blog

My nickname is Kele, which is Chinese pinyin of word "cola". I got this name since I like drinking Coke Cola during my younger life. My major in Mechanical Engineering, and have years working experience on FPGA, digital signal processing and communication system design. I wrote this blog to share some of my knowledge and thought. Also, most importantly, for fun.

I write content of this blog in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format and convert them to HTML using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). A Python script helps me to invoke command recursively for every file. I decided to build the site using Pandoc instead of a static generator (like Jekyll) because I found I actually wasted more time on tweaking the tool than writing content.

Domain [kele14.me](https://kele14.me) registered on [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) and static content hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/kele14x/kele14x.github.io).
