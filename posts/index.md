Hi, I'm Kele. Welcome to my personal blog, a place to log some of my random thought. Current topics included here:

## FPGA Design

### General Design

### Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Design

Generally target on Xilinx's device. However, some parts should still suit for general design (e.g., Intel device and ASIC).
