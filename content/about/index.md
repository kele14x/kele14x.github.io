title: About Me and This Blog

My nickname is Kele, which is Chinese pinyin of word "cola". I got this name since I like drinking Coke Cola during my younger life. My major in Mechanical Engineering, and have years working experience on FPGA, digital signal processing and communication system design. I wrote this blog to share some of my knowledge and thought. Also, most importantly, for fun.
